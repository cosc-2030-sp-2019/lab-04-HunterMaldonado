There are many differences between Binary trees, a binary search, and a binary search tree. 
To begin binary trees are list that at mnost have 2 children. Their pointers point to either
the left or right data and you can traverse through them inOrder, preOrder, or postOrder.
Binary searchs are different in the sense that it is a search method commonly used on arrays where
you basically cut the array in half and keep doing that till you find what you are
looking for. 
In a Binary search tree it is different because the tree is organized and orderly. You are able
to search the tree and look for max and mins, values that are greater than or less than, and 
do it efficiently becdause of how organized it is.
